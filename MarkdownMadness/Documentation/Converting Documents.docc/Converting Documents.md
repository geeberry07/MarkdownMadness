# ``MarkdownToolkit``

MarkdownToolkit is a comprehensive framework designed to provide a collection of reusable tools for Markdown rendering across various Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS). It aims to simplify the development process by offering pre-built components and utilities, reducing boilerplate code and speeding up the implementation of Markdown features.

## Overview

MarkdownToolkit addresses the common struggles developers face in implementing Markdown rendering, offering a cohesive set of components that handle parsing, rendering, and styling Markdown content. By leveraging this toolkit, developers can focus more on application logic and user experience rather than reinventing Markdown rendering from scratch.
